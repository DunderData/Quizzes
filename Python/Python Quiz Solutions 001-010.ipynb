    "Take a look at the following two function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func1():\n",
    "    return 5\n",
    "\n",
    "def func2():\n",
    "    return(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `func1`, `return` is not a function, while in `func2` it is a function. True or False?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution - January 29, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "**`False`** - `return` is not a function. It is always a **statement**. It is [detailed here in the official documentation][1]. Placing parentheses after it does not change what part of the language it is. See the [Python Language Reference][2] for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The different meaning of parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `func1` and `func2` use the `return` statement to return the integer 5. In `func2`, the line `return(5)` is interpreted as `return` and then `(5)`. The parentheses here are the same parentheses that are used to control the order of execution. Take the expression `3 * (4 + 5)`. The parentheses mean \"do the operation `4 + 5` first. With the expression `(5)` there are no operations so it evaluates as `5` and `return(5)` becomes `return 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parentheses have a completely different meaning when used to call a function. For instance, when we write `func1()`, the parentheses mean \"execute the code that the function `func1` references\". Most of the time, when you see parentheses appended to a word in Python, then that word is a function. But, in the case of `return`, this isn't so. `return` is not a function. It signals to Python to return the expression that immediately follows it. In this example, the expression is very simple, just `(5)`.\n",

    "This function's single line, `return()`, is quite bizarre. It appears that `return` is a function and being called. From the previous quiz, we learned that `return` is never a function and python will interpret the line as `return` followed by `()`. So, what does `()` do? It creates an empty tuple, which is then returned from the function. We verify this below by defining the function, calling it, assigning the result to a variable, outputting this value, and obtaining it's type."
